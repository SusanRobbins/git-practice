# Git Practice Project

This is a concise Python script designed to practice core Git workflows like branching, clean commits, rebasing, and version control hygiene. It also demonstrates beginner Python logic through simple text analysis utilities.


## Features

- **Word count**: Count the number of words in a text
- **Character count**: Count the total number of characters in a text  
- **Average word length**: Calculate the average length of words in a text

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SusanRobbins/git-practice.git
   cd git-practice
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python text_utils.py
   ```

### Example Output

```
Text: 'Git is amazing for version control!'
Words: 6
Characters: 35
Average word length: 4.83
```

## Version Control Skills Practiced

This project is perfect for practicing:

- Creating feature branches for new functionality
- Making atomic commits with clear messages
- Using `git rebase` to maintain clean history
- Creating pull requests and code reviews
- Tagging releases
- Handling merge conflicts

## Learning Goals

This project was created to:
- Practice core Git workflows and version control etiquette
- Reinforce Python fundamentals like string manipulation and functions
- Build a clean, presentable GitHub repository with a clean commit history and organized structure

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
6. Open a Pull Request
